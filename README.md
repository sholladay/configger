# configger

**Description**: A configuration processor for your application.

**Documentation**: https://github.com/sholladay/configger

**Installation**: `npm install configger`

This module is designed to help you initialize configuration to state.

## Philosophy

* Your users should be able *tell your application how to behave*.
* Your application should be able to filter and validate the user-provided config.
* Your application should be able to easily process that sanitized config and turn it into state.
